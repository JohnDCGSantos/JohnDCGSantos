With over a decade of experience in healthcare as a physical therapist and doctor of osteopathy, I've recently made a career change to pursue my passion for web development. I successfully completed the Ironhack web development boot camp, and I'm excited to embark on this new journey. 

While I'm considered a junior developer, I compensate for my limited experience with a strong drive to learn. I'm a quick learner and a team player, and I'm confident that my unique blend of skills and healthcare experience will be an asset to any development team. 

My passion lies in creating responsive and well-crafted websites, apps, and JavaScript games. I'm eager to continually enhance my skills and knowledge, striving for improvement every day, so I can contribute effectively to web development projects and make a meaningful impact.

I am looking for an opportunity to join a company where I can grow and learn as a web developer and where I can put my skills to use in real-world projects.
